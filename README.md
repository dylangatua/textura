## Project Files

- **`index.html`**  
  This HyperText Markup Language file is the foundation of the website. It showcases the layout and organization of the pageâ€”essentially the blueprint. If you want to change the order of how the page is displayed, this is the file to modify.

- **`style.css`**  
  In conjunction with the HTML file, this Cascading Style Sheet describes how the HTML elements should be styled. It handles the layout, fonts, and color schemes.

- **`script.js`**  
  This JavaScript file enables user interaction with the website. It is used to generate dynamic content, enhance the user interface, and handle user input.
